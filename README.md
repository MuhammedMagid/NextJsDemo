# Next.js Project - Articles Display

This is a simple Next.js project I created to practice and learn web development. The purpose of this project is to display articles fetched from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). It also serves as a personal project to showcase some basic web development skills using Next.js 15.

## Features
- Home page displaying basics info about the project.
- A posts page to show all posts from the Json ./posts.
- About Me page.
- A contact page with a simple form to send messages.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js 15**: A React-based framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped and maintainable styles.
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: Used to fetch articles for display.
